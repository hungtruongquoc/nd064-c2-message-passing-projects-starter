1. Person Service
Responsibilities: Manages all operations related to Person entities, including creation and retrieval of person details.
Data Model: Manages the Person database entity.

2. Location Service
Responsibilities: Handles operations related to locations, such as storing and retrieving location data.
Data Model: Manages the Location database entity.
Special Considerations: This service might require a high-throughput setup, as location updates are frequent and can come from many users simultaneously.

3. Connection Service
Responsibilities: Determines connections between people based on their proximity within a certain time frame.
Endpoints:
* Find contacts within a certain distance for a given person and time range
* Create person
* Retrieve person by ID
* Retrieve all persons
* Retrieve location by location ID
* Create location data for a person
Dependencies: This service would need to call the Location Service to get location data and the Person Service to get person details.
Data Processing: Given its potentially complex and resource-intensive operations, this service might need a more robust backend, possibly with caching mechanisms or specialized databases (like time-series databases or spatial databases) to optimize proximity searches.

Considerations for Microservices Architecture:
Inter-service Communication: Use Kafka for Location service to intercepts location data from mobile devices, maintain REST API for all endpoints in Connection service, and use gRPC for Person and Location service to communicate with Connection service.
Data Management: All services share the PostgreSQL database for simplicity.
Scalability: Microservices should be designed to scale independently based on demand. For example, the Location Service might require more resources during a large conference than the Person Service.
Deployment: Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) for deploying and managing your services. This facilitates CI/CD pipelines, scaling, and recovery processes.
By breaking down the application into these microservices, I would be able to manage development cycles more efficiently, scale parts of the application independently, and ensure that each service is focused on a single responsibility.
